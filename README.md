### "New" Media Art


> Die Zeit: Do you concern yourself with new media and technology?

> Jean-Luc Godard: I try to keep up. But people make films on the Internet to show that they exist, not in order to look at things.

> Skin has become inadequate in interfacing with reality. Technology has become the body's new membrane of existence. - Nam June Paik
